<p>I'm Brian Andersen. This site will someday have some content elaborating on who I am and what I do but for now it's a glorified email server. Turns out
  brian@hove.ga is easier to type than brian@brianandersen.xyz. Don't try the latter that domain has been expired since like 2018. And turns out having "Andersen"
  in an email leads to a lot of people typing "Anderson" and me losing out on a lot of mail! That's the actual reason this exists. But I digress.</p>

<p>If you're gonna stick around you should check out the indisputable greatest rock concert in human history!</p>
